"""A descriptor module serves to describe a software module. In software engineering, a module is a unit of code that 
encapsulates related functionality, such as a set of functions, classes, or other components. Describing a module using 
a descriptor provides essential information about its purpose, functionality, and usage.

The descriptor for a module typically includes details such as:

    Name: The name of the module.
    Description: A brief overview of the module's purpose and functionality.
    Dependencies: Any external libraries, modules, or components that the module relies on.
    Functions or Methods: Details about the functions, methods, or other components provided by the module, including their names, 
    descriptions, parameters, return types, and visibility.
    Constants or Configuration: Any constants, configuration parameters, or global variables used by the module.
    Error Handling: Information about how errors or exceptions are handled within the module.
    Performance Considerations: Any performance considerations, limitations, or optimizations associated with using the module.

Overall, the descriptor for a module serves as documentation for both developers and users, providing them with the necessary 
information to understand how to use the module effectively and integrate it into their projects. It helps ensure clarity, maintainability, 
and reusability of the software components.
